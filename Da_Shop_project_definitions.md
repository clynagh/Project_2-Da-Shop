# Java/Android Project Definitions - Solo Project

## Shop



Goal: Practice OO modelling in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You are required to build an app that allows a Shop to sell goods to a Customer. Stock and items are not important. 

### MVP
The Shop must be able to:

* Make a Sale
  - The customer funds go down, shop sales go up
* Give a refund
  - The customer funds go up, shop refunds go up
* Report on income
  - Total sales minus total refunds

The Customer must:

* Have a collection of possible Payment Methods:
  - CreditCard (default), DebitCard
* Be able to select a Payment Method to pay at any Shop
* Be able to select a Payment Method to recieve a refund onto a given Payment Method

(You may find HashMaps useful for this project) 

### Project Extensions

* Add stock tracking





## General Rules (Applies to ALL projects)

* ***DO NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS*** - this includes Java Swing and similar packages. If in any doubt ask an instructor.
* There will still be stand-up at 9am every morning (10am on Friday) - you are still expected to be in every day during the project.
* If you have an idea for a project outwith the specs defined above then please discuss this with the instructors before going ahead.
